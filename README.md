# Hobbea

Hobbea is the third and last project from three backend-engineering students with the help of our instructor. Built with Symfony 3.4, it's an Airbnb-like web app that allows its users to lend or rent private swimming-pools and tennis courts. The users can either create ads, either book private swimming-pools and tennis courts. They also can create an account.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

The project uses the latest update of Symfony 3.4 for the whole architecture. We chose to conceive a service-oriented app and experimented with Webpack to handle the interpretation of the assets. Plus, the search box is powered with Google Places API. 
We coded with PHP 7.1.11.

### Installing
* First, make sure you own Composer.
After cloning the project in your CLI, go to the directory and install the dependencies with Composer:
``composer install``

* Then, in order for the SCSS files to be compiled, install NPM and install Webpack Encore. Follow the instructions in the Symfony documentation : http://symfony.com/doc/3.4/frontend.html

Before running the app and in order to visualize potential changes in SCSS files, don't forget to compile them with the following command in your CLI:
``./node_modules/.bin/encore dev --watch``

* Finally, get yourself an available Google API Key through the Google Developer Console : 

## Testing
To make you able to test the app, we used the Fixtures component 

## Versioning
As newbies, we simply used Git :)
